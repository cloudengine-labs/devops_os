# Migration Plan: DevOps-OS Logical Grouping

This document tracks the movement of files for better logical grouping:
Here’s an updated migration plan reflecting your new, **prioritized implementation roadmap** and folder structure:

---

## 🛠️ **Migration Plan for `devops_os` Refactor**

### **PHASE 1: Foundation & Clean-Up**

**Objective:** Establish a clear, maintainable repo structure and naming conventions.

#### **Steps:**
1. **Rename Scripts for Consistency**
   - `generate-cicd.py` → `scaffold_cicd.py`
   - `github-actions-generator-improved.py` → `scaffold_gha.py`
   - `jenkins-pipeline-generator-improved.py` → `scaffold_jenkins.py`

2. **Restructure Folders**
   - Move all CLI/scaffold scripts to `/cli/`
   - Move all reusable templates to `/templates/`
   - Move all documentation to docs
   - Place demo/sample apps in `/demo/`

3. **Standardize Documentation**
   - Use README.md at the root as the main index.
   - Link to Quickstart, Use Cases, and CI/CD tool guides in docs.

---

### **PHASE 2: Unified CLI Tool**

**Objective:** Provide a single entry point for all automation features.

#### **Steps:**
1. **Select CLI Framework**
   - Choose Typer (Python) or Cobra (Go).

2. **Refactor Scripts**
   - Convert all scaffold scripts into CLI subcommands under a single tool (e.g., `devopsos`).

3. **Add Interactive Mode**
   - Integrate InquirerPy for guided, interactive CLI usage.

4. **Testing**
   - Add unit and integration tests for CLI commands.

---

### **PHASE 3: Developer Experience & Usability**

**Objective:** Make onboarding and usage intuitive.

#### **Steps:**
1. **Onboarding Wizard**
   - Implement `devopsos init` for guided project setup.

2. **Demo App**
   - Add `/demo/` with a full sample app, pipeline, and K8s deployment.

3. **Dev Container**
   - Add VS Code Dev Container configuration.

4. **Improve CLI UX**
   - Enhance error messages and usage prompts.

---

### **PHASE 4: Packaging, Testing, and CI Integration**

**Objective:** Ensure the project is installable, testable, and release-ready.

#### **Steps:**
1. **Packaging**
   - Add `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml` for pip install.
   - Add versioning (`__version__.py`).

2. **CI/CD**
   - Add GitHub Actions for linting, testing, and CLI integration tests.
   - Validate templates with yamllint/kubeval.

3. **Binary Distribution (if Go)**
   - Add GitHub Actions to build and release binaries.

---

### **PHASE 5: Community and Promotion**

**Objective:** Increase visibility and encourage adoption.

#### **Steps:**
1. **Documentation Site**
   - Launch a Docusaurus site with guides, API docs, and roadmap.

2. **Branding**
   - Add diagrams, logo, and badges.

3. **Outreach**
   - Record demo videos, submit to newsletters, and promote on social channels.

**Start with Phase 1: rename and move files, update documentation, and set the foundation for CLI unification.**  
Let me know if you want a sample folder structure or migration script!

You're welcome! Now, let’s turn all that detailed feedback into a clear, **prioritized implementation roadmap** for improving your `devops_os` project.

---

## 🛠️ **Implementation Plan to Uplevel `devops_os`**

The plan is structured in **5 phases**: foundational cleanup, CLI unification, developer experience (DX), packaging & distribution, and ecosystem promotion.

---

### **PHASE 1: Foundation & Clean-Up**

📅 **Duration:** 1 week
🎯 **Goal:** Establish internal consistency, clarity, and structure.

#### ✅ Tasks:

* [ ] ✅ Rename CLI scripts with consistent names:

  * `generate-cicd.py` → `scaffold_cicd.py`
  * `github-actions-generator-improved.py` → `scaffold_gha.py`
  * `jenkins-pipeline-generator-improved.py` → `scaffold_jenkins.py`

* [ ] ✅ Organize repo structure:

  * Move all scaffold scripts to `/cli/`
  * Move reusable templates to `/templates/`
  * Centralize documentation under `/docs/`

* [ ] ✅ Standardize README format:

  * Start with `README.md` as the root index
  * Link to Quickstart, Use Cases, and CI/CD tool guides

---

### **PHASE 2: Unified CLI Tool**

📅 **Duration:** 1–2 weeks
🎯 **Goal:** Offer one command-line interface to all features.

#### ✅ Tasks:

* [ ] 🛠️ Choose CLI framework: `Typer` (Python) or `Cobra` (Go)
* [ ] 🛠️ Build CLI interface:

  ```bash
  devopsos init
  devopsos scaffold cicd --tool github
  devopsos scaffold k8s --type argo
  devopsos deploy --env staging
  ```
* [ ] 🔄 Refactor old Python scripts to subcommands (modules or classes)
* [ ] ✅ Add `--interactive` mode using `InquirerPy`
* [ ] 🧪 Add CLI unit tests (e.g., via `pytest`)

---

### **PHASE 3: Developer Experience & Usability**

📅 **Duration:** 2 weeks
🎯 **Goal:** Make onboarding and usage intuitive for new users.

#### ✅ Tasks:

* [ ] ✅ Create `devopsos init` wizard:

  * Prompts for CI/CD, app type, Kubernetes style, and generates structure
* [ ] ✅ Create a full demo app folder (`/demo/`):

  * Sample Go or Python app with full pipeline and K8s deployment
* [ ] ✅ Add VS Code Dev Container config
* [ ] 📚 Improve error messages, usage prompts in CLI

---

### **PHASE 4: Packaging, Testing, and CI Integration**

📅 **Duration:** 1–2 weeks
🎯 **Goal:** Make `devops_os` installable, testable, and release-friendly.

#### ✅ Tasks:

* [ ] 📦 Add `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml` (for pip packaging)
* [ ] 📦 Add versioning via `__version__.py`
* [ ] ⚙️ Add GitHub Action for:

  * Linting (`black`, `isort`)
  * Unit tests (`pytest`)
  * CLI integration tests (`subprocess`)
* [ ] 🔧 Generate binaries (for Go CLI, if used)
* [ ] 📁 Add prebuilt template validations (e.g., `yamllint`, `kubeval`)

---

### **PHASE 5: Community and Promotion**

📅 **Duration:** Ongoing
🎯 **Goal:** Make your project accessible, visible, and collaborative.

#### ✅ Tasks:

* [ ] 🌍 Launch a Docusaurus site:

  * Sections: Quickstart, CLI Docs, CI/CD Templates, K8s Usage, Roadmap
* [ ] 📷 Add architecture diagrams using [Python diagrams](https://github.com/mingrammer/diagrams)
* [ ] 📽️ Record a demo video: “Scaffold CI/CD and deploy to K8s in 60 seconds”
* [ ] 📩 Submit to DevOps newsletters, Hacker News, Reddit, or Product Hunt (if open source)
* [ ] 📣 Post on LinkedIn and GitHub Discussions

## 🧭 Suggested Timeline (6 Weeks)

| Week | Focus                                        |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | File cleanup, documentation restructure      |
| 2    | Unified CLI prototype & refactor scripts     |
| 3    | Interactive onboarding, scaffold CLI demo    |
| 4    | Testing, packaging, release automation       |
| 5    | Documentation site, full demo app, tutorials |

---

## 🎁 Bonus Improvements (Optional but Strategic)

* Plugin architecture: support community-contributed scaffold templates.
* Integration with GitHub CLI or GitLab CLI.
* Template Marketplace for predefined workflows.

---

## ✅ Final Note

This plan transforms `devops_os` from a great idea and toolkit into a usable **DevOps developer platform starter kit** — CLI-first, container-native, and open to extension. Follow this plan and you’ll have something not only usable internally but also marketable externally.
